// It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry about strings with less than two characters.

function removeFirstAndLastCharacters(str) {
  return str.slice(1, -1);
}

// slice(start, end) Overview:
// slice() extracts a section of a string, returning a new string, based on the start and end indices provided.
// The start index is inclusive, meaning the slice starts at that position.
// The end index is exclusive, meaning it stops just before that position.
// In Your Case: slice(1, -1)
// start = 1: This tells JavaScript to start slicing from the second character, because indexing is zero-based. So, index 1 refers to the second character.
// end = -1: In JavaScript, negative indices count backward from the end of the string. So -1 refers to the last character. However, because the end index is exclusive, it stops before the last character.
// Example: "hello"
// "hello"[1] refers to "e" (the second character).
// "hello"[-1] refers to "o" (the last character).
// But slice(1, -1) stops before the last character, meaning it only captures "ell".
// Why is it removing the first and last characters?
// Start at 1: The slice starts from the second character.
// End at -1: The slice excludes the last character.
// As a result, the first and last characters are removed.
// Visual Breakdown:
// For the string "hello":

// Characters: "h", "e", "l", "l", "o"
// Indices: 0 1 2 3 4
// Negative indices: -5 -4 -3 -2 -1
// Using slice(1, -1):

// Start at index 1 ("e")
// End before index -1 ("o", but don't include it)
// Result: "ell".
